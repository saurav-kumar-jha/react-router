My academic journey began with my completion of 10th and 12th grade from the Bihar Board, where I achieved strong results. <br />I have a passion for technology and web development, specializing as a frontend developer. I’m now expanding my skills to become a full-stack developer, eager to learn more about both the client and server sides of web applications. <br />I thrive on challenges and love bringing creative ideas to life through code. When I'm not studying or coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and keeping up with industry trends. <br /> <br />Thank you for visiting my page!</p>
